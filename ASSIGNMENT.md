# Module Documentation

The below questions should be answered (in detail!) regarding your submission.

##### 1. Reflect on how you "learned" to use the library and write the examples, c.f the "Unfamiliar APIs" reading. What is one aspect of the module's code that made is easy to understand? What is one change that would have made it easier?

I learned by choosing a library that had a familiar concept to me (dice roller) and then having a better idea of what the methods might be doing. My library used an object that had several prototype methods that you could call on it. The existence of the object was familiar to me and made the organization of the main index easier for me to understand because everything was extrapolating on that object. Looking at the examples that we were given, I think that the difficulty was too high. It was hard for me to understand how these different files within the library worked together. I think documenting a straight-forward library and then moving onto something harder would have been a better learning experience. Learning how a library is formatted with folders and different files in class would also be beneficial in my opinion. I have not had very much experience with libraries to it took a while to find one that was understandable to me and was not referencing many files with "require".


##### 2. Consider the process of writing comments that "raise the level of abstraction." What does this mean to you? If you had to explain to a new CS142 student how to write an effective comment, what would you say? #####

Raising the level of abstraction means taking a selection of code and examining what it is actually producing with what it is given. Saying what the variable's significance to the process that you are breaking down. I would explain abstraction to a cse 142 student by telling him that raising the level of abstraction means writing what your code does in english and in terms that are relevant to your overall process.


##### 3. Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this assignment? #####

I spent around 8 hours.


##### 4. Did you receive help from any other sources (classmates, etc)? If so, please list who (be specific!). #####

None besides google searches for certain pieces of code and information.


##### 5. Did you encounter any problems in this assignment we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the assignment better? #####

It took a long time to find a library that I was comfortable explaining I would like to have done one of the ones that we were recommended but it seemed like many had several "require" statements that brought in files that I could not find in the library. I didnt feel comfortable explaining those libraries because I honestly did not understand every aspect of how they worked. I also spent a lot of time figure out how to make jsdoc work mainly due to my lack of knowledge of how to work with the terminal. I had to read a lot to figure out how to use the command prompt to install JSDoc. My problem was not understanding that JSdoc was to actually be installed in the project folder itself.
